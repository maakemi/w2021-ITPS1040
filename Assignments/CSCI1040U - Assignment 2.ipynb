    "Unlike the lab assignments, these assignments contribute significantly towards your mark. Like the lab assignments, they are designed to prepare you for future tests and exams. Since the assignments are quite challenging and long, you will be working on teams of 2 to 3 people for these assignments. This is to encourage ALL team members to attempt to solve and explain their solutions to one another, which should increase what ALL team members have learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "The official policy of the instructor is that it is acceptable to discuss general strategies with your fellow students, but when it comes to actually writing code your team should do it entirely alone. Do not share your code with **anyone** outside your group. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any team who turns in work copied (in whole or in part) from another team will result in ALL students being investigated for a violation of academic integrity, which will result in failure of the assignment, a permanent record of the incident on your academic record, and possible further consequences. You’ll also find the next examination to be far too difficult, since you’ve skipped some of my planned learning objectives.\n",
